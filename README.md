# 3D Interactive Portfolio

This is my 3D portfolio website, built with React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber. It features a stylized floating island I modeled and textured myself, imported as a .glb file and rendered in real time. The site offers an interactive experience using orbit camera controls and lighting to bring the scene to life.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Custom 3D Model – Modeled and textured the floating island scene from scratch.
- 🧭 Interactive Exploration – Users can pan, zoom, and rotate the scene with OrbitControls.
- ⚡️ Fast Performance – Powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and builds.
- 🎛 Lighting Setup – Includes ambient and directional lights to enhance the visuals.
- 🌐 Responsive Fullscreen Canvas – Scales to fill any browser size with a sky blue background.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React – UI Framework
- Three.js – 3D rendering engine
- @react-three/fiber – React renderer for Three.js
- @react-three/drei – Useful helpers (like useGLTF, OrbitControls)
